# Diabetes Prediction with the Pima Indians Dataset

This repository contains teaching materials and code examples for demonstrating how to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and machine learning model training on the classic [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

## 📚 Objective

The goal is to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The target variable is `Outcome` (0 or 1), and features include:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

## 🛠️ Techniques Covered

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas and seaborn
- Data cleaning and imputation (handling 0s in medical data)
- Feature scaling
- Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC
